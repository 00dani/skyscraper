Pretty much any command line option can also be set in the '~/.skyscraper/config.ini' file. That way you don't have to type them on the command line all the time. You can also set a custom config.ini using the '-c' option.
The '~/.skyscraper/config.ini' file contain sections for both main, platform specific and scraping module specific sections. So if you, for instance, want a certain option to only be applied when scraping a certain platform, just add it to a platform specific section. Check the example at '~/.skyscraper/config.ini.example'.
You can customize the artwork Skyscraper outputs completely by editing the '~/.skyscraper/artwork.xml' file. Check the full documentation online at https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper/blob/master/ARTWORK.md. You can even set a custom artwork.xml per platform if you want in '~/.skyscraper/config.ini'.
You don't actually have to set '-s localdb' when scraping from the local cache. 'localdb' is the default scraping module so you can just leave out the '-s' option entirely which will make Skyscraper fall back to '-s localdb' automatically.
Whenever you've scraped a platform with any scraping module, it is ALWAYS a good idea to rescrape that same platform with '-s localdb' (or leave out '-s' entirely which defaults to 'localdb') to make use of the newly cached data. This will combine all of your cached data from any scraping module into the most complete results.
You can force a refresh of the locally cached data using the '--refresh' option. Skyscraper will then refetch the requested entries from the scraping sources, instead of loading it from cache. Sort of like Ctrl+F5 in a browser.
Skyscraper caches all scraped data in an internal database (referred to as the 'localdb'). This saves bandwidth for the scraping sources as any rescaping will make use of this cache instead of pounding the servers again.
You can import your own data into the local cache using the 'import' module. You can import both textual and media data. Read more about this at https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper/tree/master/import.
You can prioritize the sources of each resource type by editing the '~/.skyscraper/dbs/[platform]/priorities.xml'. Each resource type has a node with source nodes inside. If you want to prioritize a certain source for a certain resource type, just move it to the top or add it if it's not already there.
You can turn off these hints using the '--nohints' command line option.
You can force Skyscraper no never apply any bracket notes (such as '(Europe)' or '[aga]') to the game names by using the '--nobrackets' command line option.
If you don't like the returned titles of your games, you can either import your own with the '-s imort' module or force it to use the filenames with the '--forcefilename' command line option.
You can scrape a single game by adding it to the command line. You can also scrape a span of games with the '--startat' and '--endat' command line options.
By adding the '--dbstats' command line option, you can check the status of the resources that are cached for the platform you are scraping.
You can use the '--help' command line option to view all available options. Most of these can also be set in the '~/.skyscraper/config.ini'. Check the '~/.skyscraper/config.ini.example' file for all available options.
