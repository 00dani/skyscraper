**READ BEFORE YOU POST**
Do NOT ask questions unless you have read the documentation thoroughly. I am not your personal help desk and I DO NOT have time to answer questions that are already elaborately covered. With that said, I do appreciate genuine, well described bug reports or feature requests. But please take your time to describe it well using the following template. If not, I will delete it without response.

**Describe the feature**
A clear and concise description of what and how you would like this feature to be implemented.

**Contact mails and documentation**
Is your feature related to an external source? If so, do they have an API? How do I gain access to it?

**Additional context**
Add any other context or terminal output about the feature request here.
