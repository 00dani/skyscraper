## NO PULL REQUESTS
The Skyscraper project is not currently looking for collaborators and for that reason pull requests are respectfully rejected. In other words: Don't create one.

In the rare case where a pull request will be considered it will previously have been discussed and coordinated at the RetroPie forums [here](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/11826/versatile-c-game-scraper-skyscraper).
