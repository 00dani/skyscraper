#### Note for Amiga scraping
For Amiga I STRONGLY recommend you to set up your RetroPie to use WHDLoad. Follow this guide:
* http://www.ultimateamiga.co.uk/HostedProjects/RetroPieAmiga/guide.html

## How to install Skyscraper
Follow the steps below to install the latest version of Skyscraper. Lines beginning with '$' signifies a command you need run in a terminal on the machine you wish to install it on.

### Install prerequisites
Skyscraper needs the Qt5 framework to compile. For a Retropie, Ubuntu or other Debian derived distro, you can install it using the following command:
* $ sudo apt-get install qt5-default
* [enter your 'pi' user password, default is 'raspberry']

### Download and compile
Create a folder for the Skyscraper source, download the latest release, compile it and install it:
* $ cd /home/pi
* $ mkdir sources
* $ cd sources
* $ wget https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper/archive/2.1.0.tar.gz
* $ tar xvzf 2.1.0.tar.gz
* $ cd skyscraper-2.1.0
* $ qmake
* $ make
* $ sudo make install
* [enter your 'pi' user password, default is 'raspberry']

If everything went well you are now ready to run Skyscraper!

## How to use Skyscraper
IMPORTANT!!! In order for Skyscraper to work properly, it is necessary to quit your frontend before running it! If you're running EmulationStation, you can quit it by pressing F4.

### Simple mode
When you have completed the installation you can start Skyscraper in 'simple mode' by running Skyscraper with no command line options by typing:
* $ Skyscraper

Skyscraper will then ask you a bunch of questions, create an optimized script based on your answers, and finally run the script which scrapes the chosen platform in an optimal way. This is very useful for first time scrapings, as it will give you the best possible initial result for any given platform. If you're curious you can check out the generated script. It's located in '~/.skyscraper/skyscript.sh'.

### Manual mode (for advanced users)
If you'd like a bit more control over how Skyscraper scrapes, read on for a better understanding of what the script generated by 'simple mode' contains.

I recommend taking a look at the command line options first:
* $ Skyscraper --help

This will give you a description of everything Skyscraper can do if you feel adventurous!

However, Skyscraper was designed to work with default options. If you're using the EmulationStation frontend, basically all you need to do is type:
* $ Skyscraper -p [platform]

Where [platform] must be one of the supported platforms (check '--help' for a list). This will scrape using the default scraping module for that platform.

NOTE: To enable video scraping for the scraping modules that support it, you need to add the '--videos' command line option. This is disabled per default because of the significant space requirements needed to save them.

I recommend scraping with different scraping modules one after the other with the '-s' option:
* $ Skyscraper -p [platform] -s [scraper]

This will scrape using the specified scraping module instead of the default one. Every time you scrape with a new scraping module, all resources from that module will be cached locally. After you've scraped with different scraping modules, always rescrape with:
* $ Skyscraper -p [platform] -s localdb

Scraping with localdb will combine all of your locally cached resources into the most complete results. Remember to always overwrite your gamelist (keep in mind that any manual edits will be overwritten!) and NOT skip existing entries, unless you have a specific reason to do so. Read on for a more thorough description of localdb and how to prioritize the results.

### Local database features
Whenever you scrape any platform with any web scraping module, Skyscraper caches each resource locally. A resource can, for instance, be a game 'title' or a game 'screenshot'. Each game can have several versions of each resource cached locally. One of each type per web scraping module. This comes in handy when using the 'localdb' scraping module.

#### LocalDb scraping module
After a while you'll have accumulated a decent amount of locally cached data for any given platform. To exclusively make use of this data Skyscraper provides the 'localdb' scraping module (set with '-s localdb'). By using this source Skyscraper *only* scrapes from the locally cached data. Depending on how many sources you've scraped any given platform with, the 'localdb' module will give you almost perfect results, with almost no data missing. Per default any resource type is prioritized by timestamp. But it is also possible to prioritize them by scraping source. So if you prefer the 'description' results from a certain scraper, you can easily make sure that these will be prioritized above any other descriptions available. Read more about how to do this [here](dbs/README.md).

#### Update local data
Normally the locally cached data is persistent. This means that it will only allow one instance of any type of resource for any rom per scraping source. If you later wish to update the resources for a certain source, Skyscraper provides the '--updatedb' option. If this flag is set on the command line, any data in the local cache will be updated with the new incoming data. So if rom X has a description that you feel is lacking, and you've noticed that the data from a specific scraping module is more to your liking, simply rescrape the platform with '-s [scraping module] --updatedb' and the locally cached data will be updated. Then prioritize it to make use of it with '-s localdb'. Read more about how to do this [here](dbs/README.md).

#### Default db folder
The default folder for all of Skyscrapers' locally cached data is in the '[homefolder]/.skyscraper/dbs' subfolder. In this folder you'll find the individual platform db subfolders. Any platform db folder is selfcontained and can be copied to a USB drive, or zipped up and uploaded to share with friends.

#### User-defined databases
Normally Skyscraper uses a default local db folder for each platform. But a friend might have send you a copy of his local database folder, and you wish to scrape from his data. In this case Skyscraper allows you to force the use of a local database with the '-d [db folder]' command line option. Keep in mind that if your friend has zipped the db folder for convenience, you need to unzip it before use. Skyscraper does *not* currently support zipped db folders.

#### Tiny words of warning
If you start copying your local databases to and from friends, or you accumulate some really big local databases that you sleep with at night because you love them so much - ALWAYS remember to back these up from time to time! Skyscraper is software. Software has bugs. And even though I do quite a bit of testing and feel confident in my code, bugs are inevitable from time to time.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that it is entirely your own fault if you've spent 6 months creating a bunch of local db's and suddenly you overwrite them unintentionally or Skyscraper corrupts the data for some i-have-no-idea-how reason. It could happen. So... PLAN YOUR BACKUPS! And don't come crying to me. :D

### Local data import
I addition to allowing scraping from local resources, Skyscraper also allows you to import your own data into the local cache, which in turn allows you to scrape your roms with it using the '-s localdb' scraping module.

#### How it works
Skyscraper allows you to import various rom resources from the local '[homedir]/.skyscraper/import' folders. Simply place your data inside these folders with the EXACT filename of the roms you wish to connect them to. For instance, if you have a rom called 'Bubble Bobble.nes' you would place your snap for this rom inside '[homedir]/.skyscraper/import/snaps' called 'Bubble Bobble.png'. Other image file formats are also supported.

Now run the scraper with the '-s import' option:
* $ Skyscraper -p [platform] -s import

If you've named the files correctly, the game will show with a green 'YES' for cover/boxart, screenshot/snap and video. If you've imported textual data, it will show the data at the relevant output line.
Now, to make use of the imported data, scrape with the '-s localdb' scraper and your resources will be prioritized above all others, as defined in '[homedir]/.skyscraper/dbs/[platform]/priorities.xml'.
* $ Skyscraper -p [platform] -s localdb

Then start your frontend and enjoy your newly imported rom data. :)

#### Textual data import
For textual data, you need to first create a file called '[homedir]/.skyscraper/import/definitions.dat'. In this file, you must define the file content format you are providing for each rom. For instance, if your data comes in the form of 1 xml file per rom, and you wish to scrape 'publisher' for this rom, perhaps your input file has a node like '```<publisher>This is the publisher</publisher>```'. In the 'definitions.dat' file you'd then add a line looking like '```<publisher>###PUBLISHER###</publisher```'. The '```###PUBLISHER###```' tag is recognized by Skyscraper. Read a more detailed description with examples [here](import/README.md).

### Artwork look and effects for EmulationStation
Skyscraper allows you to fully customize how you want the final artwork to appear and what effects should be applied. Check the 'artwork' section in 'config.ini.example' for a full list of available options. I've also created some artwork examples to get you started. Try appending one of the following lines to your Skyscraper command line options.

#### Default: Small cover with drop shadow, larger screenshot
![Small cover with drop shadow, larger screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muldjord/skyscraper/master/artwork_examples/Bubble%20Bobble.png)

#### Big cover with drop shadow, small screenshot
Append command line option '-c config_artwork01.ini'
