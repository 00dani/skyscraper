### Artwork look and effects for EmulationStation
Skyscraper allows you to fully customize how you want the final artwork to appear and what effects should be applied. Check the 'artwork' section in 'config.ini.example' for a full list of available options. I've also created some artwork examples to get you started. Try appending one of the following lines to your Skyscraper command line options.

#### Default: Small cover with drop shadow, larger screenshot
